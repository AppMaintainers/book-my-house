## Hello candidate!

This is the project you are given tasks on during the interview process. In this app we can book a house for a given day, list the bookings and even query whether a day is already booked.

### First of all, let's run the server locally!
1. Clone this repo
2. Install ruby 2.5.1
3. Go to the projects main directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies listed in the Gemfile
4. Run `rails db:setup` to create the local database
5. Run `rails s`, then you can access the app on `localhost:3000`
